## This repo is a learning note for Programming in Lua (3rd Edition).
* I wrote something hard to understand or hard to remember in some lua files, each one seperated by its corresponding chapter.For example, chap1.lua is a note of chapter 1's reading. Meanwhile, some chapters are mainly illustrating C API or interaction btw lua and C, it is needed to write some C code. Those code are stored in some C files with a same prefix name with lua files. 
* All lua files can be excuted, just use : lua chap1.lua.
* All C files can be excuted after compling, some C files which provide library functions can be compiled using 'compile_lib.sh filename targetname'.
